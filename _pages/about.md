Welcome to my personal webpage!

My full name is Joel Daniel Andersson. I am a PhD student at the University of Copenhagen advised by [Rasmus Pagh](https://rasmuspagh.net/). It is too early to call in what direction the research will go, but it is expected to fall within the domain of [differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy). I will conduct the research as a member of the [Providentia](https://www.rasmuspagh.net/providentia/) project, a part of [BARC](https://barc.ku.dk/).

Prior to starting my PhD, I received my master's degree in Engineering Physics from Lund Unversity in 2020. My [master's thesis](https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/8998721) was written at CERN and involved designing a linear framework for orbit correction in HL-LHC. After graduating and up until recently I was a Baseband Software Engineer at Ericsson, implementing algorithms for 5G in Downlink L1.

In my spare time I enjoy running, live music, and craft beer.
